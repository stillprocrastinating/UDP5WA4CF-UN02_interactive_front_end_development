# To Do

- Keep track of all bugs, however minor.  
  Use TDD (see bookmarked `Red-Green-Refactor` lesson).

- Keep track of all UXD decisions & wireframes.

- Burger navbar menu <992px (because I didn't end up using it last time).

~~IDEA~~
~~Use a small computer keyboard to type on a piano keyboard.~~
- ~~Open composing~~
- ~~Quiz format for theory practise~~
- ~~API/scraping potential - theory info & sound production~~

IDEA II  
Use number inputs or button clicks to roll dice.
- d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100
- Total of rolled dice
- Save total
- Reset total
- Ability to roll multiple die at once
- API/scraping potential - gaming info
- Seeing list of saved rolls (ability to name rolls)

>After reviewing both of your project ideas, I recommend moving ahead with the Dungeons and Dragons Dice Roller. This idea is well-suited to the scope and technical requirements of the Milestone 2 project. It allows you to demonstrate interactive functionality using JavaScript, including working with events, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation. You can also build meaningful user interaction through multiple roll types, resetting and summing results, and user feedback. These elements align closely with the assessment outcomes outlined in the course specification.  
While your music composer idea is creative and has strong educational potential, it introduces additional complexity such as rendering musical notation and possibly generating audio. These features would be challenging to implement reliably within your current timeframe, especially when factoring in the additional work required for testing, documentation, responsiveness, and user experience. For that reason, I believe it would be better suited as a future portfolio project when you have more time and flexibility.  
In terms of aiming for a distinction, integration of a third-party API or data source is encouraged where it is appropriate to the project, but it is not a strict requirement. In your case, the core functionality of a dice roller can demonstrate all the required technical and design competencies without needing an external API. However, at distinction level, the assessment also looks for demonstration of advanced interactivity and user engagement. This can include the use of asynchronous JavaScript, which is often involved when working with APIs or external data. While your project does not naturally require external data, you might still consider adding a small feature that uses asynchronous code. For example, you could fetch data from a public API, simulate a fetch using local JSON, or introduce asynchronous behaviour with a small loading effect using setTimeout. Including something like this would allow you to evidence your understanding of asynchronous programming and further strengthen your project for distinction grading.
